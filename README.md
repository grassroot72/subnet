# subnet
Given an IP address and CIDR, calculate the subnet details!

This should be a very helpful program when you need to know the subnet mask and other subnet information.
Give an IP address and CIDR mask bit to this program, it will print out the detailed subnet information.

Try for yourself!

Happy coding ^_^
